      <p>one time i was watching better call saul and i was really hooked to that show and i keep thingking about it
        until i get a problem and i was "what would saul do?" after i start watching the show i start to think like saul everytime i got a
        problem since saul always been a really good problem solver even tho he lied almost all time. this what i mean by the title "what we watch
        affect how we act" â€” it's often we mimic how the character talk, the gesture and much more. why? i think cause we feel relate to them,
        feel like we and them have same things, like ourself from another universe.

        r: but  i was watching slasher movie all the time how im not turning to a psycho yet?
      </div>
<p> fyi a lot serial killer in history inspired by the movie they watch, but lets just use scenario when u dont become one but why dont u?
    the answer is as i mention u are not relate to the character i mimick saul cause i feel relate to the way he solves his problem thats 
    why i mimmick him thats the part of his character that i mimmick u not act like a psycho even after watch dosen of slasher movie simplyn cause
    u not feel relate to character u dont feel like having a same things as the character as for the other half hey do, i dont get how people enjoy slasher
    movie like i get it wee need a lil bit of violence to make things fun but slasher nah its just to much.
