    <h1 class="title">why we should kill every single rapist that exist in this planet.</h1>
    <p class="date">kill all rapist</p>

    <div class="content">

      <p>        what they did on earth is unforgiveable cause they left a lifetime trauma to the victims

        all those woman should life their life with no fear for such things
        
        why do wee put them in jail, for what so they can return to the society and do the same things again?
        
        all people that commit such crime doesnt deserve to walk on this planet
        
        biggest symphaty to all the victims just want to remind u that ur not broken and its not ur fault att all
        
        all rapist gotta die must be enforced asap goverment should have give the victim some choice on how they got excecuted once again once they done it they dont deserve to walk on this planet.</p>

        <p>some might think my approaches was extreme but what they did to the victims was a lot more diabolical like i mention earlier
            someone who did that should not have right to walk on earth, even if they are still left alive all of them should be exile into
            one island where all of them gather and must find their own to survive even tho they should be fucking dead.
